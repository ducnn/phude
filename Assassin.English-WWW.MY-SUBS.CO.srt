1
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,480
<i>This is not my body.</i>

2
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,050
<i>This is not my body.</i>

3
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,650
<i>These are not my hands.</i>

4
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,700
<i>This is not my body.</i>

5
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,140
Dad!

6
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,310
Dad, I told you
to stay in the car!

7
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,560
Why didn'’t you stay in the car?

8
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,450
<i>This is not my son.</i>

9
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,310
Dad?

10
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,120
<i>This is not my body.</i>

11
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,250
<i>This is not my body.</i>

12
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,890
<i>This is not my body.</i>

13
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,240
Hey, sleeping beauty.

14
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,160
My mom'’s traveling
from Cape Town next month.

15
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,550
And if you Don'’t wake up...

16
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,950
She'’s gonna smack you awake.

17
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,060
<i>"And in the aftermath,</i>

18
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:23,420
<i>she thought of all the times
they had been there...</i>

19
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,900
<i>Together.</i>

20
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,770
<i>And the promises they made.</i>

21
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,740
<i>No matter where we are
in the world...</i>

22
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,400
<i>However strange or distant,</i>

23
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,400
<i>however far...</i>

24
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,910
<i>Or impossible...</i>

25
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,710
<i>However cruel</i>

26
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,930
<i>or painful...</i>

27
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:15,420
<i>I promise you, I will never die,</i>

28
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,250
<i>unless i'’m looking
into your eyes."</i>

29
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,870
Three months.

30
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,730
Three months in a coma!

31
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,600
Are we gonna do this daily?
What happened to Sebastian?

32
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,840
How does a fucking drone pilot
land up in a coma?

33
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,520
Tell me why I shouldn'’t
fucking kill you!

34
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,540
Because you'’re not stupid.

35
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,320
Get in the car.

36
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,650
It'’s on me, what happened.

37
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,780
If I could explain it, I would.

38
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,440
Let'’s get you home.

39
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,660
Who'’s this?

40
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,460
We got a problem here?

41
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,150
You all right?

42
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,330
Who'’s she?

43
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,160
Alexa.
Sebastian'’s Alexa.

44
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:11,300
What'’s going on?
They won'’t tell me anything.

45
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,680
I have a family, please.

46
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,130
I'’ve never harmed
another person before
in my life.

47
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,580
Who are you?

48
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,660
Call harmon.

49
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,190
Yeah, about that...

50
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:48,410
<i>Senator John harmon,</i>
<i>chair of</i>
<i>the armed services committee,</i>

51
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:51,190
<i>was fatally stabbed today
by a longtime aide</i>

52
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:54,080
<i>who says he has no memory
of the attack.</i>

53
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,330
What is this? What'’s happening?

54
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,070
Everyone, get in the car.

55
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,200
Yeah, I Don'’t work for you.

56
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,610
You do now.

57
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,390
This is not a good idea.

58
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,530
Where are we?

59
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,580
Someplace safe.

60
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,150
You really think
she can handle this?

61
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,560
What'’s this?

62
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,330
Subject of my postdoc thesis.

63
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,330
Well, plus my
hawkings-level brilliance.

64
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,910
Just put her in.

65
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,650
You ready?

66
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:07,660
If you want answers
about Sebastian,
you'’ve gotta put this on.

67
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,770
Step into the tub.

68
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:35,860
Oh, hell no.

69
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,350
I worked with Sebastian too.

70
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,120
I promise
it will all make sense.

71
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,300
It'’s the only way
to get him back.

72
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,460
The ice will numb you
and help you let go.

73
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,030
Mm-hmm.

74
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:29,000
Just remember these words:
"This is not my body."

75
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,470
This is not my body?

76
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,360
"This is not my body," say it.

77
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,450
This is not my body.

78
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,300
Wait!

79
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,450
<i>This is not my body.</i>

80
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,160
<i>This is not my body.</i>

81
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,490
<i>This is not my body.</i>

82
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,580
<i>This is not my body.</i>

83
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,410
<i>This is not my body.</i>

84
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,730
Hello?

85
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,690
Who are you?

86
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,600
This is not your hand.
This is not your body.

87
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,780
What did you do to me? It'’s all right.

88
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,740
What the fuck did you do
to my hand?

89
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,220
Your hand is fine.Relax.

90
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,130
We just digitally mapped
your consciousness

91
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:35,800
into another person'’s body.

92
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,890
You told me that he was
a drone pilot.

93
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,980
This is the future
of drone warfare.

94
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:55,470
If you can'’t get
to someone, we can.

95
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:00,000
We kill the bad guys.
Somebody else takes the fall.

96
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,070
It'’s just that simple.

97
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:05,250
This is crazy.
This is sanctioned?

98
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:07,126
Do you remember
the midway shooter?

99
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,690
The police couldn'’t get close.

100
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:10,600
Yeah, his sister killed him.

101
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,650
Her finger was on the trigger,

102
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:16,190
but Sebastian was
controlling that finger.

103
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:26,620
This is Adrian delorio,
the fixer'’s fixer.

104
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,190
He can smuggle
the obamas into China

105
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:33,020
and an entire cartel
into Texas completely unnoticed.

106
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,460
This is Adrian'’s crypto guy,

107
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:40,080
who can make millions
disappear and reappear.

108
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,170
Except, it wasn'’t him at all.

109
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:47,210
Sebas... Sebastian?

110
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,770
He was in about a week.

111
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,610
Adrian must have sensed
something.

112
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,650
Wha... what'’s he doing?

113
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,950
Stealing my tech.

114
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,390
It'’s completely untraceable.

115
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,530
Burrows right
into the brain stem.

116
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,670
So what happened to Sebastian?

117
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,310
What happens when
it gets pulled out like that?

118
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:56,240
It'’s like a file transfer
that crashes mid-download.
Gets corrupted.

119
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,670
So will he ever wake up?

120
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:02,160
If you can get
that spider back, yes.

121
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,040
It won'’t matter
if we'’re all dead.

122
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,370
Adrian'’s coming for us.

123
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:10,570
All of us.

124
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,480
So you'’re hiding. No.

125
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,870
We'’re hunting.

126
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,920
So how does this work?

127
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,290
The brain is just
an electrical system,
and any system can be hacked.

128
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:44,810
Sorry.

129
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:52,000
That is your drone.

130
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,650
And this is your target.

131
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,310
How do I come home?

132
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,860
You close your eyes.

133
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,080
You feel yourself,
your real self.

134
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,260
It'’s been there all along.

135
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,840
Then you say the words
you know are true.

136
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,590
This is not my body.

137
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,420
<i>First, the occipital lobe.</i>

138
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,060
<i>Then sight.</i>

139
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,500
<i>Then sound.</i>

140
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:31,150
<i>Then the limbic system.</i>

141
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,820
<i>Motor control.</i>

142
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,080
<i>And last...</i>

143
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,910
<i>Feelings.</i>

144
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:51,690
<i>Your mind screams. It resists.</i>

145
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,930
<i>So you remind it,
"this is not my body."</i>

146
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:44,020
Who is he? Do
you really wanna know?

147
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,200
I'’m about to kill a stranger
in another person'’s body.

148
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,810
I want to know.

149
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,510
<i>He'’s Adrian'’s transport guy.</i>

150
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:00,120
<i>Traffics underage girls
out of Morocco.</i>

151
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,520
We take down Adrian'’s crew.
We flush him out.

152
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,440
We find the tech.

153
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,620
And then I kill him?

154
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,650
<i>This is not my body!</i>

155
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,590
This doesn'’t feel right.

156
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,240
He was a bad guy.

157
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,410
You'’ve killed bad guys.

158
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,200
Yeah. Not like that,
I haven'’t.

159
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,070
Do you know how many soldiers
i'’ve sent to Iraq
so we could live?

160
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,070
Nobody has to be sent anymore.

161
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,770
You have plenty of other
people that can do this.

162
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,690
I do,
but I can'’t trust them. Why?

163
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:42,180
Adrian could be
any of '’em by now.

164
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:45,620
Now, make this work.

165
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,550
Olivia.

166
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,480
Olivia! Hey, Olivia.

167
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,870
Why am I pregnant?

168
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,880
Hey. Why am I pregnant?

169
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:32,610
What'’s happened?

170
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:35,570
It'’s memory contamination.
You were just a pregnant woman.

171
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:37,220
I can feel it kicking.

172
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,830
I can feel it kicking.

173
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,310
Pull it the fuck together.

174
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,190
I got this! Back off.

175
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:44,420
No. What? Oh, my god.

176
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,280
Hey, you can'’t be them
without feeling what they feel.

177
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,060
That'’s physical sensations,
emotional states.

178
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,210
Okay. Yeah. I need
you to make it stop.

179
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,850
I can'’t.Please.

180
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:00,200
Oh, my god.

181
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,900
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

182
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,030
Here. Do you feel that?

183
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,750
There'’s nothing there.
You'’re not her.

184
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:13,840
It'’s you in your body.

185
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,650
What?

186
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:19,920
I'’m not...

187
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,570
Huh? Huh?

188
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:37,780
So do they know?

189
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:41,770
Do the hosts know
what we'’ve done to them?

190
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:45,640
Mmm. No. When you'’re inside,
it'’s like they'’re disconnected

191
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,300
from everything we think of
as consciousness.

192
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:51,530
It'’s like sleep, but no dreams.

193
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:01,230
You can stop touching me now.

194
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,540
Sorry.

195
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,720
She is a mess.
You never should have
brought her here.

196
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,980
She'’ll be fine. Fine?

197
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,370
Sebastian lasted months

198
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:23,940
before his memory contamination.

199
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,510
How long does she have?

200
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:27,680
Who the fuck cares? Get
her the fuck out of here.

201
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,220
Not gonna happen.

202
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,860
Then i'’m leaving. You leave, you die.

203
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,730
He'’ll find you.
He'’ll get inside your head.

204
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:38,710
He'’ll know everything you know.

205
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:42,930
Find a way to believe in her.

206
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,050
Who'’s first?

207
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,750
We call him Mr. Bubblegum.

208
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:06,910
Your drone is Mali saman.

209
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:09,450
She'’s an artist.
Mr. Bubblegum'’s her agent.

210
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,450
He likes showing her off.

211
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:38,290
<i>Why are we targeting bubblegum?</i>

212
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,130
<i>Bubblegum is selling
Mali'’s paintings to Adrian.</i>

213
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:44,750
<i>Get close to Adrian.</i>

214
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:50,170
None of that
eat-the-rich shit today.

215
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:52,930
All you gotta do is tell him
how good your work looks
in his house

216
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,260
so he can close that deal.

217
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,000
Got it?

218
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,240
Okay.

219
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,240
Take your shoes off.

220
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:09,730
You too.

221
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,640
Happy?

222
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,180
What do you think?
Good right here?

223
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,920
Looks like crap there.

224
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,050
Well, where do you want it?

225
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,830
Wherever the fuck
he'’s gonna pay the most for it.

226
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,530
Show me the hallway.

227
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:42,730
Sure.

228
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,250
That'’s my favorite.

229
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,600
Hi. <i>Adrian.</i>

230
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:01,980
Towels!

231
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,350
<i>Stay calm.</i>

232
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,260
<i>He doesn'’t know who you are.</i>

233
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,440
Oof.

234
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:11,750
The towels.

235
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,450
Oh, I should get someone. No!

236
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:25,630
Uh, can you just, um,
help take them out?

237
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,850
Uh, sure.

238
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,950
<i>Gun. Glass.</i>

239
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:47,560
And...
This one'’s gonna hurt.

240
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,000
Two.

241
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,350
You okay?

242
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,100
Mmm.

243
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,300
All right.

244
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,870
So let'’s keep the pain away
from that mind of yours.

245
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,320
Tell me about that painting.

246
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:11,530
I just paint.

247
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:15,940
Uh, toddlers paint.
Your painting'’s
a lot more refined.

248
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,410
I'’m not good at describing it.

249
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:21,080
Well, try.

250
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:35,260
"All my life,
I dreamed beneath the sea,

251
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:39,010
and I looked upon the surface.

252
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:43,820
Till one day I crashed
into the surface

253
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:47,190
and looked upon the sea."

254
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:56,760
It'’s a line
from a book I was reading
while I was creating.

255
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,720
Can I tell you something?

256
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,600
I mistook you
for a complete stranger.

257
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,170
But we have a lot more
in common than I thought.

258
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:18,250
We both know that
<i>web of humanity</i> is
the best book on the planet.

259
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:22,990
And that'’s from a guy
who hates love stories.

260
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:25,310
Uh, how is it a love story?

261
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,780
How is it not?

262
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:31,650
It'’s revenge. Pure and simple.

263
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:36,010
Well, for someone
who recited so eloquently

264
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:38,760
from what is clearly
one of her favorite books...

265
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:42,490
Maybe you'’re missing
the poetry of it.

266
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:47,060
"I gazed and gazed
until the surface became
a reflection.

267
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:50,430
Neither sea nor sky
a reflection of itself."

268
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:52,820
Well, I hate poetry.

269
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:56,130
What? Why?
You'’re an artist.

270
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,960
You Don'’t know anything
about me.

271
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:03,960
Well, tell me about you.

272
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,870
I bought that book
for someone I love.

273
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,360
We were gonna read it together.

274
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,890
We never got the chance to.

275
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,580
And i'’m not sure we ever will.

276
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,630
What happened to him?

277
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:27,550
Something I wouldn'’t wish
upon my worst enemy.

278
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:32,470
Well, let'’s drink to that.

279
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:39,470
Cheers.

280
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:48,040
Mali? Mali?
Are you okay?

281
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,530
You Don'’t look okay.

282
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:58,746
What are you doing?
You weren'’t coming back.

283
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:00,356
I was worried about you.
I pulled you back.

284
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,350
I was with him! What?

285
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:04,760
Adrian.
Put me back in! Now!

286
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,110
How did I...

287
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,290
You okay?

288
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:32,470
Yeah, I, uh...
I get dizzy spells sometimes.

289
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:34,650
It'’s...
It'’s probably the blood.

290
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,790
I'’m fine.

291
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:44,180
Hey, what'’s up? Sorry.

292
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,830
No, it'’s fine.

293
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:48,180
<i>You kill him,
his network goes underground,</i>

294
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,400
<i>and he loses our tech.</i>

295
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,800
I'’m sorry to hear that.
How can I help?

296
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,620
<i>This guy lives in the shadows.</i>

297
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:59,030
<i>He could disappear at any
second and be gone for years.</i>

298
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,280
Find a way to keep him close.

299
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,950
Great.
See you tomorrow.

300
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,040
Hey, boss.

301
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:19,620
Oh, uh, my apologies.
I... I have to go.

302
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,190
Take care of that foot.

303
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,750
Wait!

304
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,880
You just bought
my entire collection.

305
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,020
And I Don'’t sell just to anyone.

306
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:35,630
I'’d love to get
to know you more

307
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:38,460
or the deal'’s off.

308
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,630
Mmm.

309
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:42,210
I'’ll send a car at 4:00.

310
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:55,780
Ow.

311
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,080
There you are.

312
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,650
When did this happen?

313
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:02,490
Wait, did you let me
drink again?

314
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:30,850
<i>Alexa,
Adrian knows we'’re on to him.</i>

315
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:34,200
<i>Kill everyone
that can help him disappear.</i>

316
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,506
I'’ll find someone
to take the blame for you.

317
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:39,220
Trust me, you'’re not gonna
find a better lawyer
in this town.

318
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,030
Tell those kids
not to touch my car.

319
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,320
Hey.

320
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,520
Sorry.

321
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:10,540
Okay, I gotta go. Hey, wait!

322
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:14,170
I think I lost my key.
Would it be underneath your car?

323
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,990
It'’s done.

324
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,780
I'’ve checked the cameras.

325
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,920
Lay low. I'’ll be in touch.

326
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,260
<i>This is not my body.</i>

327
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,340
<i>This is not my body.</i>

328
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,980
<i>This is not my body.</i>

329
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,720
<i>This is not my body.</i>

330
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,600
<i>This is not my body.</i>

331
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,720
<i>This is not my body.</i>

332
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:24,920
<i>This is not my body!</i>

333
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,750
<i>This is not my body.</i>

334
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,410
<i>This is not my body.</i>

335
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,200
<i>This is not my body.</i>

336
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:12,770
It'’s time to see Adrian.

337
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:15,210
You good?

338
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:53,510
<i>This is not my body.</i>

339
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,310
This is not my body.

340
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:02,140
This is not my body.

341
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,620
This is not my body.

342
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:24,210
This is not my body.

343
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,560
What do you think?

344
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:44,430
I think I still can'’t
believe this is your home.

345
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:47,100
Still much more of
a house than a home.

346
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:51,060
Oh, i'’d love to see
the rest of it.

347
00:43:57,590 --> 00:43:58,630
Isn'’t it beautiful?

348
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,970
I'’d love to settle down
here someday,

349
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:04,160
with the right person,
of course.

350
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,290
I have a
<i>web of humanity</i> story too.

351
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:07,300
Someone wanted to share it
with me.

352
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:10,600
But at the time, I didn'’t know
how to share anything with her.

353
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:15,780
Anyway, one day, I woke up
and realized she had no idea
who I was.

354
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:19,790
I mean, she had a version of me,
but I wasn'’t that person
anymore.

355
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:23,700
So I walked, and of course,
the moment I walked,
I started to miss her.

356
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:27,970
But I found her again
in the book.

357
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:30,320
Saw her on every page.

358
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:34,060
Saw all the reasons why
she wanted to share it with me.

359
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,510
And I fell in love with her
all over again.

360
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:38,860
I see it as a love story.

361
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:43,300
A love story
I can never get back.

362
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,180
I can relate.

363
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:53,480
I like being here with you.

364
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:06,270
Are you okay?

365
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:08,590
Uh, too much for a first date?

366
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:12,900
I, um...
I didn'’t think this was a date.

367
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:16,230
Sorry, I misread it.

368
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:19,290
No, um, I just have to leave.

369
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:12,730
She should be back by now.

370
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,700
It'’s taking too long.

371
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,300
<i>Hey, you'’ve reached Mali.</i>

372
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:22,840
<i>Leave a message.</i>

373
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:28,880
Pull her out.

374
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:33,090
It'’s not working.
Something'’s wrong.

375
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:14,530
She looks tired. Not "she."

376
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:17,440
You. Alexa.

377
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,370
Alexa'’s just a body.

378
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:24,190
Don'’t!

379
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:26,310
It would break you to feel
both at the same time.

380
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,940
I Don'’t even know
what would happen.

381
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:31,760
He could have followed you here.

382
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,170
It'’s time to go.

383
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:35,780
I can'’t.

384
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:38,950
I Don'’t know how.

385
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:47,920
I kept hearing my own voice.

386
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:51,740
Seeing my own skin.

387
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:56,280
I kept saying the words,
but it didn'’t...

388
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:58,930
It didn'’t work.

389
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:02,200
I couldn'’t come back, so I...

390
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,680
I came back here.

391
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,380
Whatever you'’re feeling
right now, use it.

392
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,640
Remember who you are.

393
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:21,430
You'’re here. You see it.

394
00:49:23,350 --> 00:49:25,520
Now, find your way back.

395
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:31,490
What would he do...

396
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:36,580
When it got like this?

397
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:43,370
Sebastian?

398
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:52,200
He would go home to you.

399
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,450
It'’s time to go.

400
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:57,210
You got two hours to come home,

401
00:49:58,030 --> 00:49:59,430
or i'’ll pull the fucking plug.

402
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:22,520
<i>Hey, you'’ve reached Mali.</i>

403
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,020
<i>Leave a message.</i>

404
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:10,320
Let'’s go for a drive.

405
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:33,620
<i>Hello.</i>

406
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:36,990
Hey, did we party last night?

407
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:39,610
<i>No. You said you
were staying in.</i>

408
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:42,920
Well, I Don'’t
remember anything.

409
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,720
<i>Where are you right now?</i>

410
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,740
<i>I Don'’t know.</i>

411
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:21,960
<i>Come back to me.</i>

412
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:26,180
<i>What if I Don'’t know how?</i>

413
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:30,710
<i>Then i'’ll
have to come find you.</i>

414
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:41,720
What can I get you?

415
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:44,490
Grilled cheese with tomato.

416
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:47,800
Do you know what
they call that? A happy waitress?

417
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,540
A happy waitress.

418
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:51,080
And for the lady?

419
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:52,860
I'’m not hungry.

420
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:56,600
Your husband
always ordered lobster.

421
00:52:57,390 --> 00:52:59,110
At the diner.

422
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:00,480
Like an amateur.

423
00:53:03,610 --> 00:53:07,040
He wasn'’t an amateur.
You just didn'’t know him.

424
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,520
I spent months in
the safe house with him.

425
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,840
Oh, yeah?
So why did he order
lobster then?

426
00:53:15,970 --> 00:53:17,520
We were in Baghdad.

427
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:21,400
We got pinned down in
this bombed-out apartment,

428
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:25,070
and I was shaking in
my boots, and he was calm,
talking about...

429
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:30,200
"If we had to go out
to dinner tonight...

430
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:35,210
Where would you wanna go?
What would you wanna eat?"

431
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:38,780
And I just said,
"lobster."

432
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,130
And that was it.

433
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,990
For the rest of our
lives, he was always,

434
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:49,660
"someday, i'’m gonna
take you out for lobster."

435
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:51,750
Why someday?

436
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:56,530
Because he was allergic
to shellfish.

437
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:00,230
Said he had to work up
tolerance.Amateur.

438
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,100
And he always fights for me.

439
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:05,760
For us.

440
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:09,500
And that'’s why
this is really hard,

441
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:13,160
because I just
feel like he'’s...

442
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:18,160
Gone.

443
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:20,900
Keep that connection.

444
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:23,340
These other bodies,

445
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:25,740
these other lives,

446
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:28,250
it'’s just noise.

447
00:54:28,450 --> 00:54:29,960
Tune it out.

448
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:32,180
You'’ll make it.

449
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:38,660
Need the bathroom.

450
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:48,760
A happy waitress, sunshine.

451
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:04,640
Hey, i'’ve been
looking all over for you.

452
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:10,420
Grilled cheese and tomato.
A happy waitress.

453
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:14,000
I'’m happy, Mr. Valmora.
Are you happy too?

454
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:21,530
You enjoying the weather?
Get any bug bites lately?

455
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:30,000
It'’s so nice to see you again.

456
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:33,460
You'’re dead, you son of a
bitch. Only if you find me first.

457
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,900
Adrian got him.

458
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:48,810
Got me too.

459
00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:52,780
He'’s gonna use me now
to kill you.

460
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:57,520
You finish this.

461
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:05,400
I can already feel him
in my head.

462
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:08,750
Come on!

463
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,360
You'’ve always wanted this.

464
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,600
I'’d do it.

465
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:12,900
How do I know you'’re you?

466
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:16,070
You Don'’t.

467
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:19,430
Well, they'’re both dead,
and i'’m going home.

468
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:23,770
You go home, Adrian wins.

469
00:57:23,970 --> 00:57:26,510
Someone, some day,
is gonna put a knife
in your throat,

470
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:28,660
and you'’re never
gonna see him coming.

471
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:18,840
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

472
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:27,520
Alexa, tomorrow, you see Adrian.
Tomorrow, you finish this.

473
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:30,610
Okay.

474
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:51,640
Come back to me.

475
01:00:55,170 --> 01:00:56,210
Please.

476
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:13,400
I'’m gonna do something
really hard now,

477
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:15,840
but...

478
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,590
I need you to hold me.

479
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,750
Who are you?

480
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,580
I'’m... get out!

481
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:18,280
Oh, hi, Mali.
Was he expecting you?

482
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:14,660
What are you doing here?

483
01:03:19,490 --> 01:03:20,700
I wanted to see you.

484
01:03:24,490 --> 01:03:25,710
It'’s not a good time.

485
01:03:28,630 --> 01:03:31,240
What happened? Leave me alone!

486
01:03:45,210 --> 01:03:49,340
What if I Don'’t
wanna leave you alone?

487
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,050
Look, talk to me.

488
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:08,140
Just tell me where you are.

489
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:13,760
I ran into an old friend.

490
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:16,150
Didn'’t go so well.

491
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:21,640
Me too.

492
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:28,560
What do you need right now?

493
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:36,040
If you want me to leave,
I can leave,

494
01:04:36,870 --> 01:04:39,870
but I was hoping I could stay.

495
01:05:01,110 --> 01:05:04,900
Sometimes, the only thing
that makes sense...

496
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:13,030
The only thing that
makes me feel like me

497
01:05:14,690 --> 01:05:17,730
is... touch.

498
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,910
<i>First, find the spider,</i>

499
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:08,610
<i>then you can kill him.</i>

500
01:06:09,870 --> 01:06:11,530
<i>This is not my body.</i>

501
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:17,530
<i>This is not my body.</i>

502
01:06:18,620 --> 01:06:20,670
<i>This is not my body.</i>

503
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:22,450
<i>This is not my body.</i>

504
01:06:23,410 --> 01:06:25,450
<i>This is not my body.</i>

505
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:28,940
<i>This is not my body.</i>

506
01:06:30,850 --> 01:06:31,980
<i>This is not my body.</i>

507
01:08:17,570 --> 01:08:20,090
What happened? I Don'’t remember.

508
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:25,170
Why am I here? I pulled you out
when you lost consciousness.

509
01:08:25,370 --> 01:08:26,950
Here. I Don'’t need this.

510
01:08:27,150 --> 01:08:28,870
You should change
out of your wet suit.

511
01:08:29,070 --> 01:08:30,540
What are you talking about?

512
01:08:31,890 --> 01:08:33,150
What the fuck?

513
01:08:37,670 --> 01:08:40,590
I didn'’t wanna get
you undressed. Who am I right now?

514
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,330
Who is standing in front of you?

515
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:48,680
Alexa.

516
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:52,430
Oh, god.

517
01:08:54,210 --> 01:08:57,250
What happened in there?
Just tell me and we'’ll fix it.

518
01:08:57,450 --> 01:08:58,770
You can'’t fix it!

519
01:08:58,970 --> 01:09:01,730
I can try.
Just come back.

520
01:09:01,930 --> 01:09:03,400
I'’m still her!

521
01:09:07,830 --> 01:09:08,830
Who sent you?

522
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:10,820
Where the fuck am I?

523
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:25,720
What is it? Make it stop!

524
01:09:27,030 --> 01:09:28,380
Please make it stop!

525
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:44,000
What is it? He disconnected me.
He disconnected me.

526
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:52,260
Fuck. What the fuck happened in there?

527
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:54,870
I found the tech.
I found Sebastian'’s spider!

528
01:09:55,070 --> 01:09:56,740
Fuck.

529
01:09:56,940 --> 01:09:59,220
I'’m calling the wet team.
He'’ll be dead in half hour.

530
01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:02,050
Listen, Mali is in there.

531
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:04,370
I can'’t let him kill her! What the fuck?

532
01:10:06,070 --> 01:10:07,630
I'’m gonna finish this.

533
01:10:56,550 --> 01:10:57,840
Let me go! Help me!

534
01:12:48,010 --> 01:12:49,490
<i>This is not my body.</i>

535
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:54,930
<i>This is not my body.</i>

536
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:25,300
<i>This is not my body.</i>

537
01:13:58,090 --> 01:13:59,390
Alexa...

538
01:14:03,260 --> 01:14:04,700
I love you.

539
01:14:58,790 --> 01:15:00,230
Alexa!

540
01:15:05,890 --> 01:15:08,050
Wait, I Don'’t...
I Don'’t understand.

541
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:11,630
Oh, I missed you. I missed you.

542
01:15:13,630 --> 01:15:14,640
Hey.

543
01:15:16,030 --> 01:15:17,420
Wait, I Don'’t...

544
01:15:23,990 --> 01:15:24,990
I saw you get shot.

545
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:28,690
You saw what
I wanted them to see.

546
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Okay.

547
01:15:33,650 --> 01:15:34,660
Okay.

548
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:36,790
Why?

549
01:15:39,570 --> 01:15:41,490
I couldn'’t be
Sebastian anymore.

550
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:44,540
They broke me, Alexa.

551
01:15:45,930 --> 01:15:48,060
Don'’t you feel broken too?

552
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:01,500
<i>They could turn off the machine,</i>

553
01:16:01,700 --> 01:16:04,060
<i>but they couldn'’t
disconnect me.</i>

554
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:07,910
<i>All the other lives
rattling around in my head.</i>

555
01:16:09,780 --> 01:16:11,340
<i>Like a fire in my brain.</i>

556
01:16:14,090 --> 01:16:17,520
<i>And the only way to put it out
was to stop being me.</i>

557
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:23,390
<i>If I could disappear,</i>

558
01:16:23,590 --> 01:16:25,920
<i>if I could start over
as someone new...</i>

559
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:28,880
<i>I could be free.</i>

560
01:16:33,410 --> 01:16:35,220
<i>I was never shot.</i>

561
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:37,240
<i>I was already Adrian.</i>

562
01:16:51,950 --> 01:16:53,600
<i>I was finally free.</i>

563
01:16:56,390 --> 01:16:58,900
<i>But they were never
gonna stop looking for me.</i>

564
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:01,130
<i>I had to take them out...</i>

565
01:17:03,790 --> 01:17:05,620
<i>So that we could be free.</i>

566
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:34,120
You must have felt that too,
when you were Mali.

567
01:17:35,820 --> 01:17:38,160
Right? You...

568
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:40,390
You... you left me alone.

569
01:17:46,270 --> 01:17:48,620
You almost fucking killed me!

570
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:51,300
I killed for you!

571
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:54,020
And you'’ve been running around
as Adrian,
chasing another woman!

572
01:17:54,070 --> 01:17:56,780
I was grooming her for you,
so she could be your host!

573
01:17:56,980 --> 01:17:59,870
So we could take
the tech and disappear! I Don'’t want that.

574
01:18:00,070 --> 01:18:01,960
Nobody could come
looking for us.

575
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:05,530
We can go wherever you wanna be.

576
01:18:05,730 --> 01:18:07,100
Be whoever you wanna be!

577
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:08,750
I want to be Alexa!

578
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:12,370
I want you
to be Sebastian! Don'’t call me that!

579
01:18:12,570 --> 01:18:15,110
Alexa and Sebastian
are just bodies. Yeah, but it'’s not...

580
01:18:15,310 --> 01:18:17,170
We can be so much more! That'’s not us!

581
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:19,210
That'’s the whole point.

582
01:18:23,430 --> 01:18:24,940
No, no. No!

583
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:27,250
Hey! Hey, hey, hey. No!

584
01:18:27,450 --> 01:18:29,160
They used me. Don'’t do this.

585
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:31,036
I did all the dirty work... Don'’t do this!

586
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:33,260
And they got to
walk away clean! Don'’t do this!

587
01:18:33,460 --> 01:18:35,650
Hey! So we'’re gonna walk away clean,

588
01:18:35,850 --> 01:18:37,436
and you'’re gonna be the one
that'’s gonna suffer.

589
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:39,570
Please, Don'’t do this!
Don'’t do this, please!

590
01:18:39,770 --> 01:18:41,000
Sebastian! Sebastian is gone!

591
01:19:25,230 --> 01:19:28,350
<i>"I promise you, i'’ll never die,</i>

592
01:19:28,550 --> 01:19:30,330
<i>unless i'’m looking
in your eyes."</i>

593
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:53,830
Been months.

594
01:19:56,530 --> 01:19:57,880
How are you holding up?

595
01:20:02,310 --> 01:20:03,450
I, uh...

596
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:07,840
I Don'’t know.
I'’m... i'’m fine.

597
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:11,270
It'’s normal to have feelings.

598
01:20:11,470 --> 01:20:17,020
You were her and now you'’re...
You'’re just you again.

599
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:22,320
Anyway, you hadn'’t
checked in, so I...

600
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:24,290
I just wanted to make
sure you were okay.

601
01:20:27,770 --> 01:20:29,040
I'’m okay.

602
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,090
She'’s gone missing.

603
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:38,520
You haven'’t seen her, have you?

604
01:20:42,530 --> 01:20:43,570
No.

605
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,100
Not a sight.

606
01:21:05,030 --> 01:21:06,060
You hungry?

607
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:08,500
Hello, we all good in here?

608
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:10,330
I am drowning in here.

609
01:21:10,530 --> 01:21:11,890
Can you take over?

610
01:21:12,090 --> 01:21:13,090
Of course.

611
01:21:13,180 --> 01:21:17,220
No, I mean take over.

612
01:21:18,260 --> 01:21:19,390
I got you.

613
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:18,320
You have a beautiful family.

614
01:22:22,930 --> 01:22:23,930
Me.

615
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:32,510
Your auntie.

616
01:22:37,250 --> 01:22:42,040
And one day,
i'’ll tell you all about...

617
01:22:49,570 --> 01:22:51,140
Your father.
